About BC-HCK
============

Originally derived from mchck project. I simplified the design a lot to make more of
a bare bones board, and extended the size to get more pins at the edge.
I also incorporated ideas from TinyK20 board, the pin layout is similar (https://github.com/ErichStyger/mcuoneclipse/tree/master/tinyK20).

The schematic design and layout was done using Kicad, a Free Software EDA tool for Linux, Windows and Mac OS (http://kicad-pcb.org/download/). You will need KiCad to open the files - gEDA or Eagle will not work.

Note: this project needs the new stable version of Kicad (4.0.0 or later), previous versions can not read the new files.
